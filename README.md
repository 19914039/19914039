- 👋 Hi, I’m Suresh
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity of Grid Edge Devices like DERs, Microgrid and also intrested in exploring SCADA and substation cybersecurity
- 🌱 I'm passionate about securely integrating Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) into distribution systems. My research focuses on ensuring secure communication for DER devices at the edge, enabling smooth connectivity with the cloud. I specialize in developing affordable, secure gateways to seamlessly integrate DERs, aiming to advance sustainable energy infrastructure. Leveraging open-source solutions, I design robust security frameworks for DERs to promote interoperability and scalability.
- 💞️ I'm eager to connect with professionals and researchers in sustainable energy and security to collaborate and innovate for a greener future. Let's work together towards a more efficient energy landscape!
